## Git setup

    - `git init`
    - Create a `.gitignore`-file with the following contents:
~~~{.sh}
Assets/CodingJar*
Assets/Demigiant*
Assets/InControl*
Assets/MiddleVR*
Assets/UnityVS*
Assets/Zenject*
Assets/Plugins*
Assets/Editor*
[Ll]ibrary/
[Tt]emp/
[Oo]bj/
[Bb]uild/
# Autogenerated VS/MD solution and project files
/*.csproj
/*.unityproj
/*.sln
/*.suo
/*.user
/*.userprefs
/*.pidb
/*.booproj
~~~

- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Initial."`
- Add the UFZ Vislab Unity package as a git submodule:
    - `git submodule add https://github.com/ufz-vislab/unity Assets/UFZ`

> Now you can start working. For organization please put nothing project specific into the *Assets/UFZ*-directory. Project specific files such as Meshes, Materials, etc. have to be put into a new subfolder `Assets/_project`!

## Backup

It is recommended to backup your project on *visdata*:

~~~{.sh}
git init --bare /Volumes/visdata/unity/repos/my-project-name.git
git remote add origin /Volumes/visdata/unity/repos/my-project-name.git
git push -u origin master
~~~

# How to setup a scene with basic VR functionality

Under *Assets/UFZ/Scenes* you can find scenes containing basic functionality:

- **VRBase**: Contains everything to build a VR-enabled application such as the VRManager from MiddleVR, Navigation scripts, VR menu scripts
- **SimpleLighting**: Contains a directional light source

These scenes can be loaded into your actual application scene with the *Advanced Additive Scenes*-plugin. To add a scene:

- *Menu / GameObject / Create Other / Coding Jar / Sub-Scene / Import From Existing Scene*
- Choose the scene in the file browser

The loaded sub-scene is now part of your actual scene and you cannot change it. To make modifications click *Unlock* in the inspector of the *Sub Scene*-script.
